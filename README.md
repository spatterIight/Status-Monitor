# Status-Monitor

Status Monitor is the easiest way to monitor running processes.

If the process you're monitoring stops running for any variety of reasons the script will trigger and you will be notified.

Simply input the name of the process you'd like to monitor, the interval at which you'd like to monitor, the methods by which you want to be notified, and the respective configuration. You can start the monitoring process by hitting the 'ON/OFF' button.
